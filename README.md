# Smart Contract Auditors and Audits

> This project is conducted as part of the bachelor thesis titled "Exploratory Study of Governance Tokens and Decentralized Ecosystems."

This repository contains a list of smart contract auditors and their respective audits. Smart contract audits play a crucial role in ensuring the security and reliability of decentralized applications. By conducting thorough assessments of smart contract code, auditors help identify potential vulnerabilities, coding errors, and logic flaws, thereby mitigating risks and enhancing the overall integrity of the project.
